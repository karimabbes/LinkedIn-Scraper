**Subject:** Follow-up on Simplifying Real Estate with Technology  

Dear Charlotte,  

I hope this message finds you well. I came across your profile and was truly impressed by your expertise in real estate—your work at Bonaparte Art de Vivre reflects a deep commitment to excellence, which is inspiring.  

I wanted to follow up on my previous note (sent by my colleague Karim) regarding a tech solution designed to support real estate agents like yourself. Our goal is simple: to create tools that save time and streamline your daily tasks, based on real insights from professionals in the field.  

If you’re open to it, I’d love to hear your perspective—what challenges do you face that tech could help solve? No sales pitch, just a 20–30 minute conversation. As a thank-you, you’d get early access to the solution. You can book a slot here at your convenience:
